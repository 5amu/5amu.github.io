## Introduction

I'm stable on Arch on my laptop since the last post. I've tried Manjaro and 
other distributions in the meantime, but nothing makes you forget the 
distribution you're running like Arch Linux and derivatives.

## The metadistro

It advertise itself as Arch Linux for pentesters, and it cannot be more 
accurate! Here's the website [blackarch.org](https://blackarch.org/).

The setup for an existing installation of every Arch derivative cannot be more 
easy. They have a script that takes care of everything: 
[blackarch.org/strap.sh](https://blackarch.org/strap.sh). It essentially adds a
source to pacman, making more that 2.5k pentesting tools available.

Because of these guys, I completely stopped using Kali Linux on my laptop.

## Wrapping up

Very good job guys! Check them out if you are a pentester.
