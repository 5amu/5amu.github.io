I have decided to maintain a repository for my own comfort in switching OSs as 
they were candies... The repository is 
[os-setup](https://github.com/casalinovalerio/os-setup.git), and it contains 2 
scripts, `linux.sh` and `windows.ps1`. Those are reachable also at the urls:
[strap.casalinovalerio.com/linux.sh](https://strap.casalinovalerio.com/linux.sh)
and [strap.casalinovalerio.com/windows.ps1](https://strap.casalinovalerio.com/windows.ps1)

The Windows Powershell script removes crap, telemetry and animations, then 
installs the software I need, while the Linux one downloads and sets my ssh keys
up, initialize my home directory and installs my favourite softwares as well.

The Linux one auto recognise the Linux distribution and behaves consequently, 
the Windows one works on any up-to-date installation.

Check it out and enjoy!
